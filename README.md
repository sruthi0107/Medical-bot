# Medical Bot

This project is a basic chatbot intended to identify preliminary medical conditions and provide remedies and related information. The chatbot is hosted on a Flask app that 
takes in speech as user input, identifies the disease, scrapes the web to find relevant information about the disease and displays it on the website.

## Quick Start

1) Install all the packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Run the script using `python User_application.py`
3) Open the local host link generated to view the website
